# Array Iteration Mini-Lab

### I'm so busy
```ruby

farmer_tasks = ["Milk the cow", "Churn the butter", "Drive the tractor", "Peel Potatoes", "Plant the corn"]
```
Use `.each` to print out the string "I'm so busy! I need to #{task}" for each of the tasks in the farmer_tasks array.

### Add ten and divide by two
```
some_numbers =[2,52,19,46,1000]
```
Use `.each` to add ten to each number and then divide it by two. Store the new returned result in an array called `numbers_plus_ten_halved`.
Puts this new array.

### Reverse Presidents
 ```
 presidents = ["George Washington", "John Adams", "Thomas Jefferson", "James Madison", "James Monroe", "John Quincy Adams"]
 ```

Use `.each` to print out a string with the name reversed for each of the presidents in the `presidents` array.


### 10 Bottles of Milk on the Wall
Create an array with the numbers 10 down to 0. Using `.each`, for every number puts the string "___ bottles of beer on the wall", filling in the blank with the number in your array.
